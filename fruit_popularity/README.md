# Fruit Popularity Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyses favourite fruits among a group of individuals. The dataset was created directly in Python, without using any external files. The main goal is to visualise fruit popularity using a bar chart and provide insights into preferences.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes three fruits:

- Apple  
- Banana  
- Orange  

Each fruit is associated with the number of people who selected it as their favourite.

## Bar Chart Components

**X-axis (Favorite Fruit):**  
The horizontal axis displays the types of favourite fruits: Apple, Banana, and Orange.

**Y-axis (Number of People):**  
The vertical axis shows how many individuals selected each fruit.

**Bars:**  
Each bar represents a unique fruit, and the height of the bar indicates its popularity:  
- Red bar: Apple  
- Yellow bar: Banana  
- Orange bar: Orange  

## Interpretation
- Apple is the most popular fruit in this dataset.  
- The bar heights provide a clear visual comparison of fruit popularity.

## Conclusion
This simple bar chart offers a clear summary of fruit preferences among the surveyed individuals. It helps identify the most and least popular fruits.

## Further Work
- Expand the dataset with more respondents.  
- Include demographic details such as age or region to explore patterns.  
- Add other visualisations like pie charts or stacked bar charts.  
- Consider interactive plots using `plotly` for a more engaging analysis.
