# DataVis_SimpleExamples

A collection of simple datasets showcasing basic data visualisation techniques. Each dataset is organised in its own folder, illustrating outcomes and insights. Each folder contains:  

- Python code for generating and analysing the data  
- An image showing the visualisation outcome  
- A brief description or summary of findings

This structure allows easy exploration of different datasets and demonstrates how simple data can be visualised effectively. In the future, datasets may also be provided as CSV files for more flexibility and analysis.

## How to Use

1. Open a dataset folder.  
2. View the folder’s `README.md` for a brief explanation of the dataset.  
3. Run the Python code to reproduce the analysis.  
4. View the visualisation outcome image.  
5. Repeat for other dataset folders.

## Future Work

Additional datasets and more complex scenarios can be added over time, including analysis of trends, timing, and other advanced visualisation techniques.
