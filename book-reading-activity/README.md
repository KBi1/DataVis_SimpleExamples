# Reading Activity Bar Chart

## X-axis (Names)
The horizontal axis lists the names of the people in the dataset. Each bar corresponds to one person.

## Y-axis (Number of Books Read)
The vertical axis shows the number of books read. The height of each bar reflects how many books that person completed.

## Bars
Each bar represents one individual. For example, Alice has a bar height of three, indicating she has read three books.

## Interpretation
The chart makes it easy to identify who reads more or less. Grace has read the most books, while Bob has read the fewest. The varying heights of the bars provide a simple visual view of reading levels across the group.

## Conclusion
The bar chart offers a quick way to understand reading habits within the dataset. It highlights how engaged each person is with reading and provides a clear comparison of activity levels.

## Future Work
The analysis could be extended to explore reading habits in more detail, such as:  

- The timing of reading sessions  
- Which days reading occurred  
- Patterns in reading behaviour  

This would provide deeper insight into why certain individuals, like Grace, read more books than others.
